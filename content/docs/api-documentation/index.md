summary: A guide on how to use Piped's API.
---

## API Servers

A list of public instances can be found at https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/wiki/Instances

To keep up-to date with the instances list, you are expected to dynamically parse it.

An example on how this can be done is available at https://github.com/TeamPiped/Piped/blob/85e2296dc410fd20375d623465900c55b5483da9/src/components/Preferences.vue#L202-L221

## Base URL

For all endpoints in this documentation, you will have to use an API url as a prefix. For example, the official instance's base URL would be https://pipedapi.kavin.rocks

## Unauthenticated Endpoints

These endpoints work un-authenticated, and you're highly discouraged to send an `Authorization` header for these endpoints.
